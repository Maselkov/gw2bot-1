# gw2bot-site
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pen-mb/gw2bot-site.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pen-mb/gw2bot-site)

The website of [GW2Bot by Maselkov](https://github.com/Maselkov/GW2Bot). Deployed at [gw2bot.info](https://gw2bot.info/)
The purpose of the website is to provide information about the bot, present its features and make it more accessible.

To run gw2botsite.py locally, use ``pip install -r requirements.txt``. After that, start gw2botsite.py and go to localhost:5000 on your browser.

The project uses Bootstrap 4.0.0 Beta. My own workflow for compiling SASS is included in the form of a 
``gulpfile.js`` that I run as a task in Visual Studio Code. If you use the same setup, make sure the paths in ``bootstrap.scss`` matches your Bootstrap installation.

Feel free to check the issues for a list of to-do's, to submit your own idea(s), report bugs and leave your general feedback aswell. It's all appreciated.

If you want to contribute, go ahead and make a fork, pull request and everything else. Thanks up front!
