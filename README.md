# gw2bot-site
A website repository for [GW2Bot](https://github.com/Maselkov/GW2Bot) by Maselkov.

The purpose of the website is to provide information about the bot, present its features and make it more accessible.

To run the gw2botsite.py locally, you need Python 3, together with ``flask`` and ``requests requests_oauthlib`` installed via ``pip``. After that, start gw2botsite.py and go to localhost:5000 on your browser.

The project uses Bootstrap 4.0.0 Beta. My own workflow for compiling Sass is included in the form of a 
``gulpfile.js`` that I run as a task in Visual Studio Code. If you use the same setup, make sure the paths in ``bootstrap.scss`` matches your Bootstrap installation.

Feel free to check the issues for a list of to-do's, to submit your own idea(s), report bugs and leave your general feedback aswell. It's all appreciated.

If you want to contribute, go ahead and make a fork, pull request and everything else. Thanks up front!
