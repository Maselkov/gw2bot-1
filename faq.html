            <h2>F.A.Q</h2>
            <h3>How do I use the bot?</h3>
            <p>After the bot has been added to the server using <a href="https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=310050883100737536&scope=bot&permissions=27648">this link</a>,
                you can access the commands using $ prefix. Type $help for list of all commands. Server admins can change
                the prefix to something else using $prefix</p>
            <h3>How do I setup game update notifications?</h3>
            <p>First, you must have the "manage server" permission. Provided you have that, first point the bot to the channel
                where it'll post announcements, using $updatenotifier channel. After that, enable it using $updatenotifier
                toggle on. Make sure the bot has permissions to talk in that channel.
            </p>
            <h3>Does the bot work in DMs?</h3>
            <p>Yes. API keys are cross-server too, if you're in multiple servers with the bot.</p>
            <p>I want to thank everyone who has contributed so far, whether it was reporting an issue, making a suggestion or
                helping on github. You're great.</p>
            <p>And of course Twentysix, without <a href="https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot">Red</a> the development
                of this bot would be much slower.</p>
