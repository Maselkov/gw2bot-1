  <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
  <hr>
  <h4>How do I use the bot?</h4>
  <p>After the bot has been added to the server using <a href="https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=310050883100737536&scope=bot&permissions=27648">this link</a>,
    you can access the commands using $ prefix. Type $help for list of all commands. Server admins can change the prefix
    to something else using $prefix.</p>
  <h4>What is guildsync?</h4>
  <p>Guildsync is a feature which allows you to sync your in game ranks with discord roles. In case of issues, follow these guidelines:
   <p> Guild sync requires leader permissions in game. </p>
    <p> Guildsync is tied to your account. If you remove your API key, guild sync will break</p>
    <p>Always ensure that GW2Bot is above the synced roles, or the bot won't be able to assign them</p>
    <p>You can modify and change permissions of the roles created by the bot - but don't delete them. In case you do delete them $guildsync now will regenerate them for you.
    <p>Only server members with API key added to the bot will participate in the sync, and no input is required from them. New members which add their API key after sync is setup will also be synced automatically.</p>
    <p>Guild sync isn't instant - it can take even 30 minutes before your settings are synced. To force a sync, you can use $guildsync now.</p>
  </p>
  <h4>Does the bot work in DMs?</h4>
  <p>Yes. API keys are cross-server too, if you're in multiple servers with the bot.</p>
  <h4>How do I setup game update notifications?</h4>
  <p>First, you must have the "manage server" permission. Provided you have that, first point the bot to the channel where it'll
    post announcements, using $updatenotifier channel. After that, enable it using $updatenotifier toggle on. Make sure the
    bot has permissions to talk in that channel.</p>
