  <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
  <hr>
  <h4>How do I use the bot?</h4>
  <p>After the bot has been added to the server using
    <a href={{invite_link}}>this link</a>, you can access the commands using $ prefix.
    Type $help for list of all commands. Server admins can change the prefix to something else using $prefix.</p>
  <h4>What is guildsync?</h4>
  <p>guildsync is a feature which allows you to sync your in game ranks with discord roles. In case of issues, follow these
    guidelines:
    <p>guildsync requires leader permissions in game.<br>
    guildsync is tied to your account. If you remove your API key, guildsync will break.<br>
    Always ensure that GW2Bot is above the synced roles, or the bot won't be able to assign them.<br>
    You can modify and change permissions of the roles created by the bot.<br>
    Only server members with API key added to the bot will participate in the sync, and no input is required from them.<br>
    New members who add their API key after sync is setup will also be synced automatically.<br>
    guildsync isn't instant - it can take even 30 minutes before your settings are synced. To force a sync, you can use $guildsync now.</p>
    <h4>Does the bot work in DMs?</h4>
    <p>Yes. API keys are cross-server too, if you're in multiple servers with the bot.</p>
    <h4>How do I setup game update notifications?</h4>
    <p>First, you must have the "manage server" permission. Provided you have that, first point the bot to the channel where
      it'll post announcements, using $updatenotifier channel. After that, enable it using $updatenotifier toggle on. Make
      sure the bot has permissions to talk in that channel.</p>
