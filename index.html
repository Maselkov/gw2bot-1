            <h2>How do I use the bot?</h2>
            <p>After the bot has been added to the server using [this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=310050883100737536&scope=bot&permissions=27648),
                you can access the commands using $ prefix. Type $help for list of all commands. Server admins can change
                the prefix to something else using $prefix</p>
            <h2>How do I setup game update notifications?</h2>
            <p>First, you must have the "manage server" permission. Provided you have that, first point the bot to the channel
                where it'll post announcements, using $updatenotifier channel. After that, enable it using $updatenotifier
                toggle on. Make sure the bot has permissions to talk in that channel.
            </p>
            <h2>Does the bot work in DMs?**</h2>
            <p>Yes. API keys are cross-server too, if you're in multiple servers with the bot.</p>
            <h3>Moving on...</h3>
            <p>The bot is under active development. Current commands will be expanded and new ones added. I'm open to all suggestions
                - just shoot me a message.</p>
            <p>If you want to help with development, you can see the [GitHub](https://github.com/Maselkov/GW2Bot) page.</p>
            <h3>Closing words</h3>
            <p>I want to thank everyone who has contributed so far, whether it was reporting an issue, making a suggestion or
                helping on github. You're great.</p>
            <p>And of course Twentysix, without [Red](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot) the development of this
                bot would be much slower.</p>
